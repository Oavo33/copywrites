        <h2 class="subtitle">Important Announcement</h2>
        <p>Hi, thank you for making it this far into all the information that we have put on Our Hub. The team hopes you like what we have to offer you, and it's all free! You get help, information, free giveaways, an amazing passageway to our social media presence, and maybe meet with some community members/neighbours just like you and have a nice chat or a bit of lively banter that could brighten up your day/week/month/year/forever. We have not mentioned the past few years with price rises and a complete change to our community, locked in our own house!</p>
        <p>But we will now! And we've done this for a reason! We have been through 2 world wars! We have been through the rise and fall of many world-changing features! We have invented flying objects and made seawater drinkable! We have been through so much more and always come out the other end shining! WE ARE HUMAN! And that makes us the most resilient, dominant, and loving creatures on the planet! Let's all get our community back and get together to save our planet, "Please."</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Copywriting Information</h2>
        <p>All the team wanted this bit of Our Hub to be as honest as we could portray. One of our big points of honesty we want to show you is down to copywriting. We will give you our point of view on the matter from the team's perspective, then we will show you the official rules on copywriting in the UK and worldwide.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Patent and Copyright</h2>
        <p>The best thing we can tell you is "do your own research" on this subject and you might be very surprised! Because if you have a new product for the world to see, then you will need a "patent," and that will cost a lot of money! If you have an idea for the world to see, then you will need to "copyright" it, and that will cost you no money!</p>
        <p>To have a new product, you will have to get in touch with your local patent office and file for a patent ,Then prove to the patent office that you are the first person in the world to apply for that certain patent! This can take a lot of time and money.</p>
        <p>To get copyrights, you will have to create something called a "fingerprint" regarding whatever idea you have. This can be in the form of a written evidence piece that you can specifically prove to be from a date and point in time! If you have done a good enough fingerprint, then you can release your content free anytime!</p>
                                                                          <p>A new product could be : A new shape ladder ,fastest ever space rocket , flying car/hoverboard ,interactive community notice boards .<br>
A new idea could be : A book written by you ,painted picture, music , movies and theatre, architectural works ,computer code .

      <section>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Online Publishers</h2>
        <p>If you are wondering why we have GitHub in our link address, then we have left it there for a reason! GitHub is one of the most commonly used "online publishers" in the world, and in the team's opinion, one of the easiest to use! All the team has said, "how easy their interface and integrations are to use"! And the more you use GitHub, the faster you get at the process of publishing your original content online. We want everyone to know how easy it is to create your original content online with copywriting and the means to do it. Hope the team didn't rabbit on too much? See you soon at one of the community projects coming up.</p>
